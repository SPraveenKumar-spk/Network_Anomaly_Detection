# Network Communication Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on identifying anomalies in network communication using machine learning models trained on the KDDCUP dataset. Upon detecting anomalies, the system sends an email notification to the network administrator, providing detailed information about the detected anomaly.
# Project Overview
1. Anomaly Detection: Detect anomalies in network traffic using classification models.
2. Email Notification System: Notify the network administrator immediately upon detecting an anomaly.
3. ML Models Utilized: 
	- Random Forest Classifier: Achieved 98% accuracy.
	- Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved 95% accuracy.
	- Naive Bayes: Achieved 79% accuracy.

# Tech Stack and Libraries
- Programming Language: Python
- Dataset: KDDCUP Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/galaxyh/kdd-cup-1999-data/download?datasetVersionNumber=1)
